## What we learned

Building any project in a small time span is tough. A big challenge we faced during our development was splitting up the parts of the project so that everyone had something to do. The sections included building the Chrome extension, developing the API, and creating a front-end.

Coordination between teams is difficult, and this was our first time trying to write working code while ensuring that all the parts would work together. We used a combination of Google Docs and Github's issue tracking for communication.

Most of the technologies we used were new to us, and we had to read through lots of documentation to see how they worked. Lots of these technologies also involved difficult new concepts, such as image parsing and asynchronous function calls.

Also, apparently certain Chrome extensions portions don't log to the console. We learned how to debug with alerts instead.

## Future Ideas

 * Save text, videos, and other media
 * Chrome extension has more features
 * "Create a big picture with all the small pictures" -Sambhav
 * Update front-end to have a more aesthetic interface
